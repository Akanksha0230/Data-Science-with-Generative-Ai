        "Proper indentation is important in Python because it defines the structure and nesting of code blocks. In Python, indentation is used to indicate the scope of control flow statements (such as loops and conditionals) and the definition of functions, classes, and other code blocks. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unintended behavior, as Python relies on indentation to determine the logical structure of the code."
